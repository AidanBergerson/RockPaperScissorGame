# RockPaperScissorsGame

Welcome to the **RockPaperScissorsGame** project from the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). This project builds a fun and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game using SwiftUI while introducing key programming concepts like conditionals, randomization, and user interaction.

## 🚀 About the Project

**RockPaperScissorsGame** is a simple yet engaging game where the user competes against the app in a classic match of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The app randomly chooses a move, and the player must choose their move to either win or lose based on the app's instruction.

## 🛠 Features

- **Randomized Moves:** The app generates a random move (rock, paper, or scissors) for each round.
- **Win or Lose Goals:** Players must choose their move based on whether the app challenges them to win or lose.
- **Score Tracking:** The app tracks the player's score based on their performance.
- **SwiftUI Interface:** Clean and intuitive design for seamless gameplay.
